# Hello, welcome to my Github repository!

Here you can find supporting files that do not necessarily belong in the Project submission, but can be accessed in case of emergency. :)

What can you find here?

Alternative code that I wrote but ended up not using.
Old versions of my code.
a final code backup.
A PDF export of my final python code with outputs.
